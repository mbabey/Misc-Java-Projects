# Miscellaneous Java Projects

In this repo are several small Java projects I worked on as assignments while a student at BCIT.

## Word Counter

Word Counter is just that: a program that counts words. It scans an input text file and stores the words as objects in an ArrayList. As words are added, they are compared to the other words in the ArrayList. If a word being scanned matches a word already in the list, the word in the list's frequency is incremented. At the end of the input file being scanned, the words are sorted in terms of frequency from highest to lowest. Then, the user enters a number of most frequent words to view, and those words are displayed on the console. This program was built as a part of a first-term object-oriented programming class.
